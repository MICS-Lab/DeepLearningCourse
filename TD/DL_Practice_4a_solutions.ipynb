This function should take in the `trial` object from Optuna as an argument and use the `trial` object to define and sample the hyperparameters that you want to optimize. For example, you can use the `trial` object to sample a choice between a convolutional and dense network, and to sample the number of neurons for the chosen network. After training the model, we will need to return the final validation accuracy calculated with cross-validation* as the objective function value for Optuna to maximise.\n",
